#8 Write a Python program input a string and   to count occurrence of a word in text.

text = input("Enter text: ")
word = input("Enter word to count: ")
print("Occurrences:", text.lower().count(word.lower()))



#From pdf

input_string = input("Enter text: ")
word = input("Enter a word to count its frequency in the above text: ")
words = input_string.split()
freq = words.count(word)
print(f"The word {word} appears {freq} times in the text.")
#Or you could define a function. The below code does the same thing as the code above.
def count_word(text, word):
    words = text.split()
    frequency = 0
    for w in words:
        if w == word:
           frequency += 1
    return frequency
freq = count_word(input_string, word)
print(f"The word {word} appears {freq} times in the text.")
